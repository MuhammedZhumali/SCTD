# Smart City Data Dashboard

An interactive, code-only project that ingests urban datasets (traffic, weather), performs time-series forecasting, and displays insights in a web dashboard.

---

## Overview

- **Data Ingestion:** Load and visualize traffic JSON, weather CSV  
- **Forecasting:** Use Prophet to predict next-day temperature trends  
- **Dashboard:** (TBD) Streamlit or FastAPI + Plotly for interactive UI  
- **CI/CD:** Docker containerization and GitHub Actions (pytest, flake8)

---

## Features

1. **Traffic data** from TrafficData_API JSON endpoint  
2. **Weather CSV** ingestion with pandas  
3. **Prophet model:** 30-day forecast, cross-validation (MAPE, RMSE, coverage)  
4. **Plotly:** interactive time-series and component plots

---

## Tech Stack

- **Data:**        pandas, NumPy, requests  
- **Forecasting:** Prophet  
- **Viz:**         Plotly  
- **Dashboard:**   Streamlit or FastAPI + Plotly  
- **CI/CD:**       Docker, GitHub Actions
